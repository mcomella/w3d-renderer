As a derivative work of the **Game Engine Black Book: Wolfenstein 3D**, which I
believe is a derivative work of the Wolfenstein 3D source code, I have licensed
this under the licenses available with the Wolfenstein 3D source releases: the
original [wolf3d source] (LICENSE-id.txt), the [wolf3d-browser source]
(LICENSE-gpl.txt), and the [Wolf3D-iOS source] (LICENSE-gpl.txt). This seems to
match the licensing of the long-running [Wolf4SDL project].
