# W3D Renderer
This is a partial reimplementation of the [Wolfenstein 3D][wiki] (w3d) renderer.
This project was inspired by the very enjoyable [**Game Engine Black Book:
Wolfenstein 3D** by Fabien Sanglard][gebb]. I read it once to understand the
algorithms then rederived and reimplented them â€“ it was a lot of fun! The w3d
renderer is a software renderer that uses raycasting with the Digital
Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm to solve for intersections. I've
implemented the following features:
* Wall rendering + texture mapping (using w3d shareware textures)
* w3d shareware maps

See TODO.md for other functionality I may implement.

## Running
To run with w3d textures & maps:
* Download the source
* `mkdir <repo>/w3d-assets`
* Download the shareware version of Wolfenstein 3D and extract `*.WL1` assets
into the `w3d-assets` directory
* Host the page, e.g. `python3 -m http.server`
* Open the page in the browser, e.g. http://localhost:8000

To run without w3d textures & maps using my demo textures & map:
* `git checkout v0.1-demomap`
* Host the page, e.g. `python3 -m http.server`
* Open the page in the browser, e.g. http://localhost:8000

Note: there is no wall collision detection. If you leave the map bounds, you may
run into an infinite loop. ðŸ˜…
