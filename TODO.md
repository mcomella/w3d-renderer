This is a list of functionality I may implement:
* Clean up w3d map code (it's a hack) & restore demo map functionality
* User can select maps
* User can load w3d assets locally (e.g. can be hosted from a static site)
* Correct aspect ratio / wall constant
* Add acceleration to user input
* Movement is based on time passed, not number of frames passed
* Fix infinite loop from leaving map bounds
* Fix infinite loop from intersecting exactly (e.g. 16, 16) with wall
* Draw sprites, weapon
* Improve performance
* Add doors

## Non-engine functionality
* Texture explorer tab
* Map explorer tab
* Sprite explorer tab
